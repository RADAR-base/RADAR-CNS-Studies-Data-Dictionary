The DD (20/92018) has been updated as mentioned in my email (18/9/2018) to Misha.
-IDS questions made mandatory
-landline set to "identifier"
-IDS parameters (except 13,14,15,16) set to "required"
-Field note remove for questions 13,14,15,16 in the IDS form

Still a few questions awaiting, this version (present in Test) is not yet uploaded to Github or Production.
