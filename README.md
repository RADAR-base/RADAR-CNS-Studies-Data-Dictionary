# RADAR-CNS_DataDictionaies
RADAR-CNS Data Dictionaries from each study

This repository is used to track changes to the REDCap instruments used as part of RADAR-CNS. 

Process for updating in-production REDCap Data Dictionaries (or instruments)
 1. Make the changes to the form or edit the Data Dictionary from the Staging REDCap server
 2. Test the changes on the Staging Server
 3. Download the Data Dictionary and add it to the correct folder (add it to the staging--dd branch) we'll keep this as a long running branch
 4. merge staging-dd with master
 5. add the data dictionary to the Production REDCap server for that project.
